# A Web Interface with React.js for Base Operations
This is the repository for Base Operations Inc., to keep track of some cities that might need navigations services. It is just a mini demo project to practice my skills on react.js.
The main page contains a list of existing cities, and could be reordered by different attributes. By scrolling down menu, it will show a hidden module which allows operations including adding a new city information. It also allows user to delete existing cities. More improvements may be possible if needed, such as connecting to a NoSQL database, authentication and authorization system, back-end service, online deployment and so on.
